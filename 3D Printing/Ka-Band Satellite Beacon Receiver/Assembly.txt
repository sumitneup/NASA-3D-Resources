Assembly Instructions –

1.	Attach the bottom of the Post to the display Base using glue (super glue will work). Display base is optional for added stability.
2.	Attach the Positioner Arm to the Positioner Body to create the antenna positioning unit (do not use glue yet -- this joint sets antenna elevation).
3.	Attach the Positioner Body to the top of the Post (do not use glue yet – this joint sets antenna azimuth).
4.	Attach the Ka-Band Reflector Mount to the Positioner Arm using the two pegs on the bottom of the Reflector Mount and the two holes centered on the top of the Positioner Arm (glue required).
5.	Insert the Antenna Feed through the front of the Ka-Band Reflector, and then through the center hole on the front of the Ka-Band Reflector Mount to attach the reflector to the mount (glue not required).
6.	Attach the RF Electronics Box to the back of the Antenna Feed on top of the Ka-Band Reflector Mount (glue optional).
a.	Note: the RF Electronics box has a finned heatsink on the bottom. The fins will likely not print individually unless printing very large or very high resolution. This is OK. 
7.	Assembly of Antenna Sub-Reflector:
a.	Interlock Sub-Reflector Part A with Sub-Reflector Part B (glue optional).
b.	Attach Sub-Reflector Part C to the peg on the bottom of Sub-Reflector Part B (glue required).
c.	Attach the four corners of the Sub-Reflector assembly to the four attachment points on the face of the Ka-Band Reflector (glue required). 
8.	If you wish to glue the antenna to a fixed position, set the desired position and add glue to the azimuth and elevation joints created in Step 2 and Step 3.
